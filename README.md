# Blockchain Proof of Privacy for Smart Homes

## Internet Society Zimbabwe Chapter, Golix & St Peters Mbare IoT Makerspace

The project is ISOC Zimbabwe's submission for 2018 Chapterthon. It consists of a Hyperledger Fabric application to record data shared by IoT gadgets within a connected home using Blockchain technology. It also contains a NodeJS user application that will allow home owners to query the blockchain for suspicious, unauthorised sharing of private data. 

The software was created by developers from Golix (https://golix.com/), who also mentored, in the process, students from the St Peters Mbare IoT Makerspace.

The project solves the problem of securing decentralised IoT smart home deployments using an immutable data store in the form of a private blockchain. 

### Background and Rationale (Secured Decentralised IoT/Web of Things)
IoT deployments have often been characterised by vertical stacks in which devices from different vendors do not communicate with each other out-of-the-box. This project seeks to explore the use of a Web-of-Things that operates in the same open and decentralised manner in which the World Wide Web works. This was achieved by implementing the Mozilla IoT Gateway on a Raspberry Pi within a connected home setup. 

### Project Details

**Setting up prerequisites** 
The following are prerequisites for installing the required development tools:
-   Operating Systems: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 / 16.04 LTS (both 64-bit), or Mac OS 10.12
-   Docker Engine: Version 17.03 or higher
-   Docker-Compose: Version 1.8 or higher
-   Node: 8.9 or higher (note version 9 is not supported)
-   npm: v5.x
-   git: 2.9.x or higher
-   Python: 2.7.x
-   A code editor of your choice, we recommend VSCode.
If you running on ubuntu the following will install the prerequisites for you
```
curl -O https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/prereqs-ubuntu.sh
chmod u+x prereqs-ubuntu.sh
./prereqs-ubuntu.sh
```
For Mac OS
```
touch .bash_profile
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
nvm —-version

nvm install --lts

nvm use --lts

node --version
```

 Install the Hyperledger Composer Extension for VSCode

Launch VSCode and then press the “Extensions” button on the vertical left toolbar.

Type  `composer`  into the search bar and then press the  `Install`  button next to the  `Hyperleger Composer`extension. Once the install completes you need to press the  `Reload`  button to activate the extension.

## Setting up Development environment
1.  Essential CLI tools:
    
    ```
    
    npm install -g composer-cli@0.20
    
    
    ```
    
2.  Utility for running a REST Server on your machine to expose your business networks as RESTful APIs:
    
    
    ```
    
    npm install -g composer-rest-server@0.20
    
    
    ```
    
3.  Useful utility for generating application assets:
    
    
    ```
    
    npm install -g generator-hyperledger-composer@0.20
    
    
    ```
    
4.  Yeoman is a tool for generating applications, which utilises  `generator-hyperledger-composer`:
     
    ```
    
    npm install -g yo
    
    
    ```
    
### Install Playground

If you've already tried Composer online, you'll have seen the browser app "Playground". You can run this locally on your development machine too, giving you a UI for viewing and demonstrating your business networks.

1.  Browser app for simple editing and testing Business Networks:
    
    
    ```
    
    npm install -g composer-playground@0.20
    
    
    ```

This step gives you a local Hyperledger Fabric runtime to deploy your business networks to.

1.  In a directory of your choice (we will assume  `~/fabric-dev-servers`), get the  `.tar.gz`  file that contains the tools to install Hyperledger Fabric:
    
    
    ```
    
    mkdir ~/fabric-dev-servers && cd ~/fabric-dev-servers
    
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/composer-tools/master/packages/fabric-dev-servers/fabric-dev-servers.tar.gz
    tar -xvf fabric-dev-servers.tar.gz
    
    
    ```
    
    A  `zip`  is also available if you prefer: just replace the  `.tar.gz`  file with  `fabric-dev-servers.zip`  and the  `tar -xvf`  command with a  `unzip`  command in the preceding snippet.
    
2.  Use the scripts you just downloaded and extracted to download a local Hyperledger Fabric v1.2 runtime:
    
    
    ```
    
    cd ~/fabric-dev-servers
    export FABRIC_VERSION=hlfv12
    ./downloadFabric.sh
    
    ```
    

The first time you start up a new runtime, you'll need to run the start script, then generate a PeerAdmin card:



```

    cd ~/fabric-dev-servers
    export FABRIC_VERSION=hlfv12
    ./startFabric.sh
    ./createPeerAdminCard.sh
    
```
## Deploying your application

Checkout your project and go to the folder of your project code
To deploy the `isoc-network` to your local Fabric, use the Composer CLI and execute this sequence of commands:

```

composer network install --archiveFile  isoc-network@0.0.1.bna  --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1

composer network start --networkName isoc-network --networkVersion 0.0.1 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --file isocnetworkadmin.card

composer card import --file isocnetworkadmin.card


```

To make sure your network is up you can use the following command

```

composer network ping --card admin@isoc-network

```
From here your network should be ready and you can view it from playground.
open a new terminal and run the following 

```

composer-playground

```
