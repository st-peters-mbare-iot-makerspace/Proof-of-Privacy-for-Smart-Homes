# Blockchain Proof of Privacy for Smart Homes  

**Internet Society Zimbabwe Chapter ¬∑ Golix ¬∑ St Peters Mbare IoT Makerspace**  

This project was originally submitted by the Internet Society (ISOC) Zimbabwe Chapter to the **2018 ISOC Chapterthon**. It showcased how **blockchain technology** can secure data generated by IoT devices in smart homes, ensuring **privacy, transparency, and accountability**.  

This repository provides an **evergreen version** of that project using modern Hyperledger Fabric tooling (Composer has been deprecated).

## üåç Background and Rationale  

Smart homes produce massive amounts of sensitive data. Traditional IoT systems often:  
- Share data without user consent.  
- Operate in siloed vendor ecosystems (vertical stacks).  
- Lack transparency in how data is stored and shared.  

This project explores the **Web of Things** approach, where IoT devices interoperate openly, combined with:  
- **Hyperledger Fabric**: a private, permissioned blockchain for immutable IoT data transactions.  
- **Node.js APIs**: to let homeowners query for unauthorized or suspicious data sharing.  
- **Mozilla IoT Gateway on Raspberry Pi**: as a practical way to bridge devices in a connected home.
